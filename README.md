Find an optimal solution to the ["Cities in Canada by any 3 letters" Sporcle](http://www.sporcle.com/games/rockgolf/candiac-was-201) using Apache Spark

In other words, find the smallest set of character trigrams such that each of the 200 most populous municipalities in Canada (according to the 2006 census) contains at least one of them. This project is to be understood rather as a programming exercise for its creator and an excuse for her to learn Spark ;)

As long as there are no tags in this repo, the project is to be considered unfinished.
